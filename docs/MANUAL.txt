QUICKSTART

Run main.py from the command prompt or terminal
to start the simulation.

To skip the hassle of setting up a planetary system,
choose to load a demo scenario at the initialization
prompt (there are a couple .osf scenario files in the
'scenarios' folder - simply type the file path).

The command prompt or terminal window will act 
as the command interpreter for the simulation,
and an OpenGL window will appear for 3D rendering.

You can move around the OpenGL scene using WASDQE
keys for rotation and UIOJKL for translation
(strafing) in all axes.

To control the simulation, press C in the command
interpreter window and enter commands. While you
are typing, the simulation will remain paused.

To learn more about using the command interpreter
and see the available commands (and their syntax),
enter the command 'help'.

HOW THE SIMULATION WORKS

Instead of using Kepler's Laws, which are quite
useful and accurate for most two-body systems, this
simulation calculates the motion of celestial 
bodies and spacecraft in small time steps and
integrates gravitational acceleration from all
celestial bodies currently in the simulation.

(Spacecraft maneuvers work the same way too.)

This way, no movement happens "on rails", and 
perturbations from distant bodies are always 
accounted for.

(However, if you wish, you can still make Kepler
style orbit projections, determine apoapsis and
periapsis; but if the perturbations are too high,
the spacecraft wouldn't necessarily follow the
calculated 2-body orbit path.)

One phenomenon the simulation currently lacks is
non-spherical gravity due to the  "lumpiness" of
some celestial bodies such as the Moon. Although
negligible beyond the low orbit of such bodies,
this should also be modeled for utmost accuracy,
especially during lengthy simulations.

Relativistic effects are not taken into account
whatsoever.

SCENARIOS (.OSF)

There are some scenario files provided in .osf
format. These are simple text files that can be
edited by any text editor you like. They contain
all information on the bodies, vessels and
maneuvers in a scenario. Syntax is rather
simple and scenarios are therefore easy to create
and edit.

Check out any of the provided .osf files and read
the comments for more information.

BATCH FILES (.OBF)

Instead of repeatedly entering some commands every
time you start a scenario, you can create batch
files to read the commands from. These too are
simple text files, and can be edited using any text
editor you like. Syntax is the same as the run-time
commands that are accepted by the interpreter.
